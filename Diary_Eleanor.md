Starting diary again on fresh branch.

So far;

- Set up bare bones template project in repo
- Created entity relationship diagram to get sense of data model
- Created queries and repository methods for retrieving only available rooms 
- Added search page so user can search for available rooms for given date range and number of guests

Next;
- Tie in Matt's code to allow user book an available room from list of available rooms. Ensure we have hit all requirements from brief.
