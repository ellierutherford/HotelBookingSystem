So far;

- Set up bare bones template project in repo
- Created entity relationship diagram to get sense of data model
- Created queries and repository methods for retrieving only available rooms 
- Added search page so user can search for available rooms for given date range and number of guests;
  - TRY IT OUT: navigate to http://localhost:8080/search. Note you will have to populate the room type and room asset tables first!
- Allow a user to book a room from list of available rooms and use provided customer details to create customer object.
  (Verified that if a room has already been booked using this flow, it won't show up as an available room within that date range for the next user.)
- Added register functionality to allow people to register as Starwood users
  - TRY IT OUT: navigate to http://localhost:8080/register
- Added login functionality. Now a user can register and then login to the web app (using Spring security in the background)
  - TRY IT OUT: navigate to http://localhost:8080/register and then to http://localhost:8080/login and login using the credentials you just created.
  - I have set up the project such that every page is accessible regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
- Added logout functionality. TRY IT OUT: navigate to http://localhost:8080/logout. Use the code in the "test" endpoint to see what user is logged in during the session (if any).
- Conditionally displayed room price depending on whether user is logged in or not. TRY IT OUT: search for a room as logged in user vs as anonymous user and see the difference in price

So what have I covered from the assignment brief?

- Show available rooms between specific dates and for a certain number of guests - DONE
- Guest users can book one or more available rooms, provide details + credit card:
  - Guest users can only book ONE room. Will not get a chance to extend this to more than one room.
  - Guest users must provide name, surname, address, phone number, email address: DONE. Nice to have would be to add validation for all this input
  - Guest users must provide credit card details - DONE
- Users can register as Starwood members;
  - Users can register by providing name, username and password - DONE. 
  - split the flow into two - step 1: user provides ALL details (phone etc as well), step 2: user creates username and password - DONE
  - TODO: this is currently horribly insecure. Need to encrypt password/use hash + salt
- Starwood users can login and logout from the system
  - Registered users can login: DONE
  - users can logout: DONE
- Guest users can retrieve their past reservations 
  - Guest users should be able to retrieve their reservations (by ID) and cancel them - DONE 
  - within 24 hours from the check-in date - DONE 
  - Reservation should indicate the rooms booked, the customer names (if necessary) and the dates for which the room was booked. - DONE except for customer names (which sounds like a nice to have)
- Show available rooms to Starwood members - DONE
  - users who successfully log in can book available rooms at discounted prices (10%): DONE
- Starwood users can book one or more available rooms: DONE
  - the user will only have to select the credit card thatâ€™s/he wants to use for payment: DONE
- Starwood members can visualize a history of their reservations: after a user performs the login successfully, Starwood members can visualize their reservations and their status (Active, Cancelled, Inactive):DONE
  - If an active reservation is selected, the user can cancel it: DONE
  - Note: all bookings are either active or cancelled, no functionality to make inactive?
- Starwood members can delete their registration: DONE
- Starwood members can save their credit card details and also modify their details: DONE
  - After a user successfully logs in, Starwood members can save their credit card details (more than a credit card can be saved): DONE

Update 09/07 - didn't get a chance to do any tidy up really, I just focussed on login functionality today. Was a bit of a slog, but finally have the login working. Next step for me - get logout working. 

Update 10/07 - logout now working, plus created a home page with links to search, login and register pages. Also added conditional display of room price depending on whether user is logged in or not. Hacky, but works for now.

Update 11/07 - updated end point for retrieving existing reservation to fulfill brief.

Update 12/07 - split booking + registration flows into two steps, plus added credit card support

Update 13/07 - allow logged in users to book rooms using previously created cards, fix cancel logic

Update 15/07 - users can view past reservations + delete their registration. Fixed bug where a booking can be saved to DB before card is added. Users can view and edit their credit card details, plus add new credit card.
All functionality finished, plus secured some dangerous endpoints (modifying card details)

NEXT: Do all tidy up and work through small improvements.

Small improvements TODO:
Make sure you can't register if already logged in
Make the input in password field in register form **** - DONE
Fix table UI when booking
Fix the expiry date in credit card
Add header to every page
Lock down non assignment related endpoints to admin only
Why does the home page "find reference" box auto populate?
General tidy up
